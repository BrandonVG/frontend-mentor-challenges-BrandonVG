## My process
I dont have much problems at doing this challenges, it did in a few hours.
I used Mobile-first workflow, once i got the mobile design i worked on desktop design, but with a min width of 1300px because i have a 1366px scree, so if i left it on 1440px i couldn't see the result by myself.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I reinforce my knowledge about how to use flexbox for responsive designs.
